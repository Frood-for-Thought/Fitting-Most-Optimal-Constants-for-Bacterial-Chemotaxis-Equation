Tumble_Angle_Function.m randomly finds the next angle the bacteria tumbles towards using the 
average tumble angle distribution it was given

Find_Diff_RawData_Program.m uses the results of "Calc_D_Per_r_Deme_Function.m"
to calculate raw data points for multiple diffusion values per deme and records everything into
a table to be exported by excel.

Calc_D_Per_r_Deme_Function.m uses the run and tumble algorithm to
calculate the distance travelled using the temporal stimulation migration equation, and
records datapoints to be used by Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m.
