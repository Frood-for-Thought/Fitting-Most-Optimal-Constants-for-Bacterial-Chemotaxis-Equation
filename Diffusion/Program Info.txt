Tumble_Angle_Function.m randomly finds the next angle the bacteria tumbles towards using the 
average tumble angle distribution it was given

Find_Diff_RawData_Program.m uses the results of "Calc_D_Per_r_Deme_Function.m"
to calculate raw data points for multiple diffusion values per deme and records everything into
a table to be exported by excel.

Calc_D_Per_r_Deme_Function.m uses the run and tumble algorithm to
calculate the distance travelled using the temporal stimulation migration equation, and
records datapoints to be used by Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m.

input_parameters.xlsx are used by initializing parameters in the "Find_Diff_RawData_Program".

The output of "Find_Diff_RawData_Program.m" generates the file,
"1.000_to_1.200_Diff_Conts_30001_DataPts_1000_Time.xlsx" which gives a list of 21 diffusion
constants from 1.00 to 1.20 with 30001 datapoints each.

creating_analyzing_df creates a dataframe out of the file "1.000_to_1.200_Diff_Conts_30001_DataPts_1000_Time.xlsx" 
so that the file does not have to be continuously reloaded every time the program is run.
The diffusion data is grouped per diffusion constant and made into histograms, 
which then are cleaned to remove outliers or means which are outside a confidence interval.
The (unitless) diffusion constant accepted is one which has the lowest Bhattacharyya Distance from the theoretical 
Gaussian diffusion distribution, (D = 112 microns/s^2, t=1000s), and one which passes the Shapiro-Wilk test.
