plotting.ipynb generates plots using the following data:

The "input_parameters" file is used by the MATLAB programs to run the simulations.  It contains information on the
food gradient, theoretical drift velocity, run speed, and the bacteria receptor activity to the attractant (food).

1.000_to_1.200_Diff_Conts_30001_DataPts_1000_Time contains bacteria diffusion datapoints generated for several
different bacteria run and tumble diffusion constants.

alpha_values_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405_curve_fit are the final alpha values by analyzing all the raw
data generated by "Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_moreIter_Function".  The Python program "fit_alpha_constant"
takes the raw data generated, cleans the outliers, and then calculates the alpha value with the
drift velocity closest to the theoretical.  
The file alpha_values_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405_curve_fit are the alpha values calculated by fit_alpha_constant
with a polynomial regressive analysis curve fit.

pos_v_time_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405 files are plots of position vs time to be analyzed in the "plotting" file.
The pos_v_time files were outputs from the "Run_and_Tumble_Algorithm_Temp_Stim_Chemotaxis" file in Drift Velocity.
