plotting.ipynb generates plots using the following data:

The "input_parameters" file is used by the MATLAB programs to run the simulations.  It contains information on the
food gradient, theoretical drift velocity, run speed, and the bacteria receptor activity to the attractant (food).

1.000_to_1.200_Diff_Conts_30001_DataPts_1000_Time contains bacteria diffusion datapoints generated for several
different bacteria run and tumble diffusion constants.

- The file alpha_values_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405_curve_fit are the final alpha values calculated by "fit_alpha_constant.py".
It also contains a polynomial regressive analysis curve fit created by "alpha_MaxC_60000_Grad_000405_CurveFit.m".

pos_v_time_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405 files are plots of position vs time to be analyzed in the "plotting" file.
The pos_v_time files were outputs from the "Run_and_Tumble_Algorithm_Temp_Stim_Chemotaxis" file in Drift Velocity.
