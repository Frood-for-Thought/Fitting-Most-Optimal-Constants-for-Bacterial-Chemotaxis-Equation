The program to execute to generate the data to analyze is "Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m". 
The data includes a list of potential alpha values per position and several velocity datappoints
from running a Monte Carlo simulation.

Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m uses the results of "Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function.m" and 
"Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_moreIter_Function" to calculate raw data points for multiple alpha 
values per deme and records everything into tables to be exported by excel which contain
the deme position, a range of alpha values, and a range of recorded velocities for the alpha values.

Tumble_Angle_Function.m randomly finds the next angle the bacteria tumbles towards using the 
tumble angle distribution it was given.

Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function.m is used to run the run and tumble algorithm to
calculate the distance travelled using the temporal stimulation migration equation, and
records datapoints to be used by Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m.

Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_moreIter_Function.m is similar to "Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function.m"
but now generates the raw data and places it into a dataframe 
for "Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m" to put the dataframe into an output file.

Run_and_Tumble_Algorithm_Temp_Stim_Chemotaxis.m reproduces the Temporal Stimulation Migration 
but is now reworked to include the fractional amount of receptor bound using the
receptor sensitivity and alpha values curve fit from "alpha_values_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405_curve_fit"
to reproduce work from work from Sourjik et al and Yu Hai Tu et al.

The Python program "fit_alpha_constant" takes the raw data generated, cleans the outliers, 
then calculates the alpha value with the drift velocity closest to the theoretical, 
and puts all the results into the file "closest_alpha_const.csv".

alpha_MaxC_60000_Grad_000405_CurveFit.m is the MATLAB program used for polynomial regressive analysis using
the file "closest_alpha_const.csv", which exports the polynomial curve fit results into the file
"alpha_values_MaxC_60000_Grad_0.000405_curve_fit".
