The program to execute is "Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m".

Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m uses the results of "Calc_R_Per_Alpha_Deme_Gillespie_Function.m"
to calculate raw data points for multiple alpha values per deme and records everything into
a table to be exported by excel.

Tumble_Angle_Function.m randomly finds the next angle the bacteria tumbles towards using the 
tumble angle distribution it was given.

Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function.m is used to run the run and tumble algorithm to
calculate the distance travelled using the temporal stimulation migration equation, and
records datapoints to be used by Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m.

Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_moreIter_Function.m is similar to "Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function.m"
but now generates the raw data and places it into a dataframe 
for "Find_Alpha_RawData_Program.m" to put the dataframe into an output file.
