The D-DEME algorithm was created several years prior than now to solve for a chemotaxis probability distribution.
This is a python conversion of the program from MATLAB.
Generate_Dynamic_Data_Points - generates the ensemble of data points each iteration from the run-and-tumble algorithm using parallel computing.
Calc_Alpha_ML_Function - The ML algorithm which avoids backpropagation to fold the ensemble gradient into the learning rate.
Find_Alpha_RawData_Program - The main execution program to utilize the run-and-tumble, and ML algorithms.
