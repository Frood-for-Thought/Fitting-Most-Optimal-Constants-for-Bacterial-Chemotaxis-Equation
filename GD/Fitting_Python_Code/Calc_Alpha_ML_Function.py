    Dynamic_Data_Evolving_Mean_Estimator, pronounced 'deme'.

    Instead of finding the mean of clusters, this algorithm generates dynamically changing data for each iteration of
    training using a stochastic function with an independent variable alpha.  This in turn produces a stochastic mean
    which is then compared to an optimal theoretical target value.  Gradient descent guides the ML algorithm to adjust
    the alpha accordingly so the dependent variable of the stochastic function will have an evolving mean that becomes
    more aligned with the theoretical value.

    The intrinsic limitation of dynamically generating normalized data are their mean's standard error.
    Therefore, the ML algorithm iteratively refines the learning_rate and max_iter, (no. data points generated),
    every number of step_size iterations in order to reduce the standard error on two fronts.  The learning_rate is
    reduced by learning_rate_gamma and the max_iter is increased by max_iter_factor so that the standard error is
    decreased by σ⁄√(max_iter_factor).  These hyperparameters will have to be balanced with the total number of
    epoch iterations in order to best minimize the standard error. The process is similar to how simulated annealing
    tries to escape a local minima, however, in this case the step_size schedules an adjustment of hyperparameters to
    minimize the intrinsic standard error.

    :param: data_generator: Has to follow the same format of the BaseDataGenerator to make sure that the object used
    has a generate_data() method.
    :param: max_iter: The number of initial training iterations (data points generated) used by the ML model.
    The generate_data() method must have max_iter as an argument.
    :param: max_iter_limit: The upper limit for max_iter to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
    :param: max_iter_factor: The factor by which max_iter is multiplied each step (e.g., 2 to double).
    :param: learning_rate: The learning rate for the ML algorithm during gradient descent.
    :param: learning_rate_gamma: The factor by which the learning rate is multiplied each step_size.
    learning_rate_gamma = 0.85 gives ~ 1/2, 1/3, 1/4.
    :param: step_size: The number of iteration the training loop goes through before it adjusts the parameters max_iter
    and learning_rate.
    :param: num_epochs: The total number of G.D. training iterations used by the ML algorithm.
    :param: theoretical_val: The target the model is trying to predict using the normalized data mean produced by
    generate_data().
