The program to run is "Find_Alpha_RawData_Program".

Find_Alpha_Program uses the results in "Calc_V_Per_Alpha_Deme_Function" to match which speed is closest to the theoretical value. 
The closest value is matched to later be used to in curve fitting to find the variable alpha value.
Then the program uses "Calc_Alpha_ML_Function" to calculate an alpha value which gives a drift velocity closes to the theoretical.
The Machine Learning algroithm is in "Calc_Alpha_ML_Function".
